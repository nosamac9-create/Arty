/**
 * The site's page-level "Back to …" control.
 *
 * Every page that steps backwards — workshop detail, both checkout steps, the
 * birthday booking and packages pages, and the two console editors — had its
 * own copy of these classes, which had drifted apart on radius, padding and
 * icon size. They are defined once here so the control cannot drift again.
 *
 * Placement is deliberately not baked in: the call sites sit in headers, cards
 * and toolbars with their own spacing, so margins come through `className`
 * rather than being fixed here. Nothing about the button's own shape, colour or
 * type is overridable, which is the point.
 *
 * Scope note: this is for page-level back navigation only. A step-back inside a
 * wizard, a segmented view switcher and a Cancel button are different controls
 * that happen to point backwards, and they keep their own styling.
