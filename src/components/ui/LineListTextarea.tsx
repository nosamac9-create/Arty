/**
 * A textarea over a string[] where one line is one entry.
 *
 * These fields all shared a bug: the value was `lines.join('\n')` while every
 * keystroke parsed with `.filter(Boolean)`. Pressing Enter makes a trailing
 * empty line, the filter dropped it, and the re-render put the caret back at
 * the end of the previous line — so a new line was impossible to type, and a
 * blank line between entries could never be held long enough to type into.
 *
 * The fix is to keep what was typed verbatim in local state while the field has
 * focus, and to report the parsed lines separately. What gets stored is
 * unchanged; only the text on screen is now allowed to be mid-edit. Blur clears
 * the draft so the field re-syncs with whatever was actually saved.
