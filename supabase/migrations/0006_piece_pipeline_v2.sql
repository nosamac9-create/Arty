-- =============================================================================
-- 0003 — pottery pipeline clean-up
--
-- Three problems this fixes, all of them data-level:
--
--  1. pipeline_stages had accumulated duplicate and retired rows, so the Kanban
--     board drew "CREATED" and "KILN DRYING" twice and Settings edits appeared
--     to do nothing — staff were editing one of several rows with the same
--     name. 0001 seeds by id with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, so the extras came in
--     afterwards (the in-app "add stage" writes `stage-<timestamp>` ids, which
--     can never conflict). This deletes everything that is not one of the six
--     canonical rows and adds a unique index on the name so a second row with
--     the same name cannot be created again.
--
--  2. pieces.status was CHECK-constrained to the eight legacy stage names, so
--     renaming the pipeline would have made every write fail. Pieces are
--     migrated onto the new names first, then the constraint is replaced.
--
--  3. piece_code had no uniqueness, which is how two cards ended up showing
--     AC-1806. A unique index now enforces it at the data layer.
--
-- Safe to re-run.
