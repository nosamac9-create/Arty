 * A second rule once lived here, cancelling Pending + Unpaid bookings 15
 * minutes after creation. It was removed: every online booking in this system
 * is paid at booking time, so it matched nothing, and it would have cancelled
 * any future pay-at-counter booking a quarter of an hour after it was taken.
 * A pay-later rule belongs with a pay-later payment model, not before one.
