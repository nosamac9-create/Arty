 * notify-own-booking — sends a customer the outcome of cancelling their own
 * booking, closing the gap docs/parked-work.md records ("No SMS or in-app
 * notification on customer self-cancellation").
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM send-sms
 * send-sms accepts an arbitrary phone number and is deliberately gated to
 * is_staff() for exactly that reason — opening it to any authenticated
 * caller would make it an open SMS relay. A customer cancelling their own
 * booking is a genuinely different authorization question: not "is this
 * caller staff", but "does this caller own the specific booking they are
 * asking about". This function answers only that: it never accepts a phone
 * number or message from the caller, only a booking id, and reads who to
 * message and what happened from the booking row itself.
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION
 * The caller must be signed in, and public.current_customer_id() — called
 * through the caller's own JWT, exactly as send-sms calls is_staff() —
 * must match the booking's customer_id. "Not found" and "not yours" answer
 * identically, the same reasoning cancel_own_booking (migration 0017)
 * documents, so this cannot be used to probe which booking ids exist.
 *
 * WHY A SERVICE-ROLE READ AFTER THE OWNERSHIP CHECK
 * The ownership check itself runs on the caller's own session, so it can
 * never be tricked into approving someone else's booking. The booking is
 * then read again with the service-role key — the same pattern
 * auto-cancel-bookings uses — so the message is composed from a read that
 * cannot be blocked or altered by RLS on a path that has already proven
 * who is asking.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES
 * - No session, or current_customer_id() is null (not a linked customer).
 * - The booking does not exist, or does not belong to this caller.
 * - The booking's status is not 'Cancelled' — this function announces a
 *   cancellation, not any other change.
 *
 * The in-app notification is not this function's job: it is written inside
 * cancel_own_booking itself (migration 0031), which already has the booking
 * row and the caller's identity in hand under SECURITY DEFINER.
